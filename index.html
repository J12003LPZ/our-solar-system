        <h2>üåö Moon</h2>
        <p>
          The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest
          satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive
          relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about one-quarter that
          of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). The Moon is a
          planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a
          satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and
          larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System. It lacks any
          significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface
          gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon
          Io being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher
          surface gravity and density.
        </p>

        <p>
          Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or
          about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence very
          slowly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides.
          The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days.
          During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface
          illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar
          phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The
          Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full
          rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near
          side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the
          same as the synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar surface
          can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.

        <h3>üåûSun</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
          perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
          reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light,
          ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source
          of energy for life on Earth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen
          into helium, and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into
          energy. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years
          to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When
          hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the
          Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a
          marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers
          expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is
          calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the
          current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable ‚Äì
          but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its
          outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white
          dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give
          off heat from its previous fusion.
        </p>

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
          System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
          that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but
          slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the
          third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
          and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was
          named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes
          one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It probably has a
          rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in
          the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing
          contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than it receives
          from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an
          oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the
          equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal
          bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.
          A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which
          has been observed since at least 1831.

        <h2>Mars</h2>

        <p>
          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
          in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In the English
          language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a
          terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of
          Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to
          Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has
          surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice
          caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and
          Deimos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus
          Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in
          the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in
          the Solar System. The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers
          approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact feature.[20]
          Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the
          planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis
          relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of Mars
          cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of
          the atmospheric pressure on Earth.[21][22] Both of Mars's polar ice
          caps appear to be made largely of water.[23][24] In the distant past,
          Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life.
          However, it is unknown whether life has ever existed on Mars.

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>
          Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
          the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
          of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
          (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator
          between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes
          (·ºôœÅŒº·øÜœÇ). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
          inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from
          Earth never exceeds 28¬∞. This proximity to the Sun means the planet
          can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern
          horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may
          appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe
          than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the
          complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs
          over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is
          tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin‚Äìorbit resonance,[19] meaning
          that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three
          times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][20] As
          seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the
          orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian
          years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every
          two Mercurian years.

        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>
          Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known
          planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the
          Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the
          densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly
          more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and
          physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more
          gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is referred to as one
          of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being
          Uranus). Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no
          well-defined "solid surface". The planet orbits the Sun once every
          164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8
          billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the
          astronomical symbol ‚ôÜ, representing Neptune's trident.[d]
        </p>

        <p>
          Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in
          the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by
          empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led
          Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to
          gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's
          death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations,
          independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was
          subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by
          Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier.
          Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though
          none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located
          telescopically until the 20th century.

        <h2>Uranus</h2>

        <p>
          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to
          the Greek god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek
          mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of
          Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest
          planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar
          System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have
          bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas
          giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify
          Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other
          giant planets.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined "solid
          surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in
          its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more
          "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other
          hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar
          System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (‚àí224 ¬∞C; ‚àí371 ¬∞F), and has
          a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the
          lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.

        <h2>Venus</h2>

        <p>
          Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called
          Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and has a
          similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like
          Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as
          morning star or evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is
          the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting
          visible shadows on Earth at dark conditions and being visible to the
          naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19]
        </p>

        <p>
          Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System. It
          has a surface gravity slightly lower than on Earth and has a very weak
          induced magnetosphere. The atmosphere of Venus, mainly consists of
          carbon dioxide, and is the densest and hottest of the four terrestrial
          planets at the surface. With an atmospheric pressure at the planet's
          surface of about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth and a mean
          temperature of 737 K (464 ¬∞C; 867 ¬∞F), the carbon dioxide gas at
          Venus's surface is in the supercritical phase of matter.

        <p>
          Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
          Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius
          of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[23][24] It has only
          one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
          volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[25][26][27]

          Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron‚Äìnickel and
          rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep
          layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen
          and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a
          pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An
          electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to
          give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than
          Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due
          to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around
          one-twentieth of Jupiter's.
